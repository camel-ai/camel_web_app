## Getting Started

### Clone Repository
You can clone this repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/camel_web_app.git
```

### Configure

Copy the `.env.example` files to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then you can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Also, you can set the following environment variables:

- `SENTRY_DSN`: (default: "") The DSN for Sentry, if you are using it, you can set it later in .env.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.

### Run all services using Docker Compose
You can run all the services using Docker Compose with:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You will see something like:
```bash
